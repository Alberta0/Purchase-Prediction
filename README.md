Understanding customer behaviours is crucial for determining whether a customer will proceed with a purchase or not. 

Previous research has shown that this decision is influenced by some key factors that are considered as the underlying reasons making the prediction process more complex.

This project explored the application of machine learning techniques in predicting customer purchase behaviourusing an e-commerce platform as a case study, 
the importance of understanding consumer behaviour in online purchasing and utilize machine learning techniques to anticipate actions based on a retail dataset and find out
what factors could be considered for predictors and how machine learning techniques can be effective to predict customer behaviour.This will aid in understanding the influencing factors. 

Highly rated models are used in implementing this study, conduct experiments on some wellknown techniques and followed by a comparative analysis.

Additionally, predict when a customer can make their next purchase in a specified number of days from their last purchase date. 

At a conclusion and with all analysis, XGB classifier resulted in being the best performing machine learning model and prediction of customer purchase date was achieved.
